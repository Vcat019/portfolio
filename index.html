   <p> My name is Vincent Michael Cataldo. I am currently working as a security guard. I live with my older brother Nick and my puppy named Ace. I'm 21 years old and I love building and designing websites! When I'm coding I feel like im creating a little world thats only a click away! I plan on getting as advanced as i can with programming and learn as much about it as humanly possible. I plan on making a career out it but I know it won't be easy. My health,knowledge,family,and future are what is most important to me.</p>

  <section class="location-section"> <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
   <p>I was born in Pittsburgh P.A. and still currently live there. I enjoy living in Pittsburgh but i wish i could travel more. The best part about living in Pittsburgh,in my opinion, is the winter. Winter is my favorite season because i think snow is beautiful and the cold is comfortable. Also, winter season=hockey season. I played ice hockey most of my life. I started when i was 6 years old and played up until I was 18. Now i just enjoy watching NHL and sometimes college.</p>
